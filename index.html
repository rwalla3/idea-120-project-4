    <h3>do u know this song?, 2024</h3>
    <a href="https://rwalla3.github.io/idea-120-project-1-rwalla3/">VISIT SITE</a>
    <p>For this project I created a flarf poem based off of browser results from the phrase “do u know this song?” I had texted the question to my brother around the time we were assigned the project. The style of the text on the website comes from the formatting styes that were copied over from Google. Some of the lines had hypertext links, some text was in bold or in various sizes; the background colors were different at times, etc.</p>

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Z62PWj36w">WATCH VIDEO</a>
    <p>The contents of this project have a few courses. The train videos were taken by me on my daily commute home on the CTA trains. I used an old Samsung digital camera to record the footage. The audio was taken in Carbondale in the rain. I was on a camping trip to see the solar eclipse, and this audio is taken from the lake within the camping grounds. The sounds you hear are of the rain drops hitting the lake and the movement of the dock. </p>

    <h3>Critters on a Train, 2024</h3>
    <a href="https://rwalla3.github.io/idea-120-project-03/">PLAY GAME</a>
    <p>My goal with this project was to create a story from multiple non-human perspectives. I again based the location off of the familiar CTA system. I sometimes imagine what life would be like as a pigeon, or rat, or other critter that frequents these train stations. </p>
